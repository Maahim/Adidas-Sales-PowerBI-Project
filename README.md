# Adidas-Sales-PowerBI-Project

In the data preprocessing phase, I created key measures and columns to gain insights into sales and profit performance across different regions in the USA. Leveraging DAX functions, I've implemented a dynamic switch between "Total Sales" and "Operating Profit."

Here's a concise overview of the insights:

1️⃣ Sales Trends: In 2020, outlet sales represented nearly 43% of the total, but this figure declined to only 30% in 2021. In-store sales also saw a decrease of roughly 12%.
2️⃣ Regional Focus: The Midwest region takes precedence as it exhibited the lowest sales among all regions.
3️⃣ Top-Performing States: New York leads in sales, closely trailed by California. Texas stands out for maintaining a consistent profit-to-sales ratio.
4️⃣ Product Champion: Men's athletic apparel emerges as the star performer due to its popularity and rapid growth.
5️⃣ Sales Growth: Adidas's sales estimate indicates a positive trajectory from FY20 to FY21, underscoring a healthy business performance.
6️⃣ Retail Insights: Kohl's retail outlet witnessed substantial growth of approximately 13 Million in FY21, while Amazon also displayed significant growth of around 10 Million during the same period.
7️⃣ Average Sales: The average sales figures surged to approximately 5 Million from FY20 to FY21, reflecting an overall business expansion.

This Power BI dashboard isn't just visually appealing; it's a robust tool for decision-makers seeking deep insights into Adidas's sales and profit dynamics. I'm committed to refining this dashboard further and adding more features to provide you with richer insights.
